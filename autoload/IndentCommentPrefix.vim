" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS
"   1.32.004	02-May-2013	Move ingocomments.vim into ingo-library.
"   1.32.003	10-Apr-2013	Move ingoplugins.vim into ingo-library.
"   1.30.002	12-Dec-2012	ENH: Add global and buffer-local whitelists /
"				blacklists to explicitly include / exclude
"				certain comment prefixes.
"   1.20.014	22-Sep-2011	FIX: Now handling three-piece comments
"				correctly. The start may set a positive indent
"				offset for the middle and end comment prefixes
"				that must be considered.
"				Factor out processing of 'comments' to
"				ingocomments.vim autoload script, so that the
"				functionality can be reused in
"				IndentTab/CommentPrefix.vim.
"				FIX: Suppress 'ignorecase' in s:Literal().
"   1.11.013	20-Sep-2011	Minor code simplification.
"   1.10.012	30-Mar-2011	Split off separate documentation and autoload
"				script.
"   1.10.011	29-Mar-2011	BUG: Only report changes if more than 'report'
"				lines where indented; I got the meaning of
"				'report' wrong the first time.
"				BUG: Could not use 999>> to indent all remaining
"				lines. Fix by explicitly passing v:count1 to
"				s:IndentKeepCommentPrefixRange() from normal
"				mode mappings and calculating the last line with
"				a cap, instead of using the implicit
"				:call-range.
"				BUG: Normal-mode mapping didn't necessarily put
"				the cursor on the first non-blank character
"				after the comment prefix if 'nostartofline' is
"				set.
"				ENH: In normal and visual mode, set the change
"				marks '[ and ]' similar to what Vim does.
"   1.02.010	06-Oct-2009	Do not define mappings for select mode;
"				printable characters should start insert mode.
"   1.01.009	03-Jul-2009	BF: When 'report' is less than the default 2,
"				the :substitute and << / >> commands created
"				additional messages, causing a hit-enter prompt.
"				Now also reporting a single-line change when
"				'report' is 0 (to be consistent with the
"				built-in indent commands).
"   1.00.008	23-Feb-2009	BF: Fixed "E61: Nested *" that occurred when
"				shifting a line with a comment prefix containing
"				multiple asterisks in a row (e.g. '**'). This
"				was caused by a mixed up argument escaping in
"				s:IsMatchInComments() and one missed escaping
"				elsewhere.
"				BF: Info message (given when indenting multiple
"				lines) always printed "1 time" even when a
"				[count] was specified in visual mode.
"   1.00.007	29-Jan-2009	BF: Test whether prefix is a comment was too
"				primitive and failed to distinguish between ':'
"				(label) and '::' (comment) in dosbatch filetype.
"				Now using exact regexp factored out into a
"				function, also for the blank-required check.
"	006	22-Jan-2009	Added visual mode mappings.
"				Enhanced implementation to deal with the
"				optional [count] 'shiftwidth's that can be
"				specified in visual mode.
"	005	04-Jan-2009	BF: Fixed changes of vertical window position by
"				saving and restoring window view.
"				ENH: The >> and << (range) commands now position
"				the cursor on the first non-blank character
"				after the comment prefix; this makes more sense.
"				Now avoiding superfluous cursor positioning when
"				indenting ranges. (Side effect from the changes
"				due to restore of window position.)
"	004	21-Aug-2008	BF: Didn't consider that removing the comment
"				prefix could cause changes in folding (e.g. in
"				vimscript if the line ends with "if"), which
"				then affects all indent operations, which now
"				work on the closed fold instead of the current
"				line. Now temporarily disabling folding.
"				BF: The looping over the passed range in
"				s:IndentKeepCommentPrefixRange() didn't consider
"				closed folds, so those (except for a last-line
"				fold) would be processed multiple times. Now
"				that folding is temporarily disabling, need to
"				account for the net end of the range.
"				Added echo message when operating on more than
"				one line, like the original >> commands.
"	003	19-Aug-2008	BF: Indenting/detenting at the first shiftwidth
"				caused cursor to move to column 1; now adjusting
"				for the net reduction caused by the prefix.
"	002	12-Aug-2008	Do not clobber search history with :s command.
"				If a blank is required after the comment prefix,
"				make sure it still exists when dedenting.
"	001	11-Aug-2008	file creation

"*******************************************************************************
"* PURPOSE:
"   Enhanced indent / dedent replacement for >>, <<, i_CTRL-D, i_CTRL-T
"   commands.
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   "Normal" prefix characters (i.e. they have screen width of 1 and are encoded
"   by one byte); as we're using len(l:prefix) to calculate screen width.
"   Folding should be turned off (:setlocal nofoldenable); otherwise, the
"   modifications of the line (i.e. removing and re-adding the comment prefix)
"   may result in creation / removal of folds, and suddenly the function
"   operates on multiple lines!
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:
"   Modifies current line.
"* INPUTS:
"   a:isDedent	    Flag whether indenting or dedenting.
"   a:isInsertMode  Flag whether normal mode or insert mode replacement.
"   a:count	    Number of 'shiftwidth' that should be indented (i.e. number
"		    of repetitions of the indent command).
"* RETURN VALUES:
"   New virtual cursor column, taking into account a single (a:count == 1)
"   indent operation.
"   Multiple repetitions are not supported here, because the virtual cursor
"   column is only consumed by the insert mode operation, which is always a
"   single indent. The (possibly multi-indent) visual mode operation discards
"   this return value, anyway.
