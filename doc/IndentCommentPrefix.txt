==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION				     *IndentCommentPrefix-description*

Indent commands like |>>|, |<<| and |i_CTRL-T|, |i_CTRL-D| in insert mode
indent the entire line. For some kinds of comments, like the big boilerplate
at the file header etc., the comment prefix (e.g. # for Perl scripts) should
remain at the first column, though.
This plugin modifies these indent commands so that the comment prefix remains
in the first column, and the indenting takes place between the comment prefix
and the comment text. For that, it uses the comment configuration provided by
the buffer's 'comment' option, which is set by most filetype plugins; this can
be tweaked via plugin configuration.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *IndentCommentPrefix-usage*

On a line like this:
# My comment. ~

The >> command now keeps the # prefix in column 1, and just indents the
comment text:
#       My comment. ~

This only works if there is at least one whitespace character after the prefix
(so that comments like ###### do not become #       ######).
Progressive de-indenting will remove all whitespace between prefix and comment
text, or leave a single space in between if the 'comments' setting requires a
blank after the comment prefix.

An optional [count] of lines can be supplied to the |>>| and |<<| commands, as
before.
In visual mode, the optional [count] specifies how many 'shiftwidth's should
be indented; the |v_>| and |v_<| commands operate on all highlighted lines.

With the optional repeat.vim script, the commands can also be repeated via |.|.

The same behavior is available in insert mode via the |i_CTRL-T| and
|i_CTRL-D| mappings.

GETTING BACK THE ORIGINAL BEHAVIOR					     *
								  *g>>* *v_g>*
g>>
{Visual}g>
In case you want to indent lines including the comment prefix, the original
indent behavior is mapped to g>> in normal mode and g> in visual mode.
(There's no need for the corresponding g<< dedent mappings, just stop
dedenting when the comment prefix reaches column 1.)
Alternatively, you could also use the >{motion} command, as the > and <
operators aren't modified by this plugin.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *IndentCommentPrefix-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim IndentCommentPrefix*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				    *IndentCommentPrefix-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (optional)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				   *IndentCommentPrefix-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

	   *b:IndentCommentPrefix_Blacklist* *g:IndentCommentPrefix_Blacklist*
By default, indenting behavior with all comment prefixes defined in the
'comments' option is modified. To disable the keeping in column 1 for some
prefixes, add each prefix to the following (buffer-local or global) List
variable: >
    let g:IndentCommentPrefix_Blacklist = ['#', '>']
<
	   *b:IndentCommentPrefix_Whitelist* *g:IndentCommentPrefix_Whitelist*
Alternatively, if you want to modify the indenting behavior only for certain
prefixes, add each prefix to the following (buffer-local or global) List
variable. These prefixes do not need to be contained in 'comments' then. > >
    let g:IndentCommentPrefix_Whitelist = ['REMARK:']
<

						   *IndentCommentPrefix-remap*
If you want to use different mappings instead of overriding the default
commands, map your keys to the <Plug>IndentCommentPrefix... mapping targets
_before_ sourcing the script (e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <Leader>>     <Plug>IndentCommentPrefix0
    vmap <Leader>>     <Plug>IndentCommentPrefix0
    nmap <Leader><lt>  <Plug>IndentCommentPrefix1
    vmap <Leader><lt>  <Plug>IndentCommentPrefix1
<
			   *g:IndentCommentPrefix_alternativeOriginalCommands*
If you don't want the alternative g>> mappings for the original indent
commands, set the following variable _before_ sourcing the plugin: >
    let g:IndentCommentPrefix_alternativeOriginalCommands = 0
<

LIMITATIONS				     *IndentCommentPrefix-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS				  *IndentCommentPrefix-known-problems*

- When indenting in insert mode via <C-T>/<C-D>, the cursor position may be
  off if there are <Tab> characters in the indented text itself (not just
  between the prefix and the indented text), and the cursor is positioned
  somewhere behind such a <Tab> character. The changing virtual width of these
  <Tab> characters isn't considered when calculating the new virtual cursor
  column.
- With ':set list' and if ':set listchars' does not include a 'tab:xy' item,
  tabs show up as ^I and do not occupy the full width (up to 'tabstop'
  characters). This shortened representation throws off the cursor position
  when indenting in insert mode via <C-T>/<C-D>.
- If a visual mode '.' repeat command is defined to repeat the last change on
  all highlighted lines, and the previous indent operation used a [count]
  greater than 1, the highlighted lines will be indented multiple times and
  lines after the current visual selection will be erroneously indented, too.
  (So it's a big mess up, don't do this.) This is because the previous [count]
  will now be used repeatedly to select multiple lines.

TODO						    *IndentCommentPrefix-todo*

- Does it make sense to also modify the >{motion} operators?

IDEAS						   *IndentCommentPrefix-ideas*

==============================================================================
HISTORY						 *IndentCommentPrefix-history*

1.30	13-Dec-2012
- ENH: Add global and buffer-local whitelists / blacklists to explicitly
  include / exclude certain comment prefixes.
- Handle readonly and nomodifiable buffers by printing just the warning /
  error, without the multi-line function error.

1.20	22-Sep-2011 (unreleased)
- FIX: Now handling three-piece comments correctly. The start may set a
  positive indent offset for the middle and end comment prefixes that must be
  considered.
- FIX: Suppress 'ignorecase' in s:Literal().

1.10	30-Mar-2011
- Split off separate documentation and autoload script. Now publishing as
  Vimball.
- BUG: Only report changes if more than 'report' lines where indented; I got
  the meaning of 'report' wrong the first time.
- BUG: Could not use 999>> to indent all remaining lines.
- BUG: Normal-mode mapping didn't necessarily put the cursor on the first
  non-blank character after the comment prefix if 'nostartofline' is set.
- ENH: In normal and visual mode, set the change marks '[ and ]' similar to
  what Vim does.


1.02	06-Oct-2009
Do not define mappings for select mode; printable characters should start
insert mode.

1.01.009    05-Jul-2009
BF: When 'report' is less than the default 2, the :substitute and << / >>
commands created additional messages, causing a hit-enter prompt.  Now also
reporting a single-line change when 'report' is 0 (to be consistent with the
built-in indent commands).

1.00.008    23-Feb-2009
- BF: Fixed "E61: Nested *" that occurred when shifting a line with a comment
  prefix containing multiple asterisks in a row (e.g. '**').
- BF: Info message (given when indenting multiple lines) always printed "1
  time" even when a [count] was specified in visual mode.

1.00.007    29-Jan-2009
Initial publish.

0.01	11-Aug-2008
Started development.
